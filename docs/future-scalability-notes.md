# üöÄ Future Scalability Notes

> **Reminder notes for the future development of Coretilla Backend**

---

## üîç 1. Blockchain Indexer Integration

### Current Issues

- Querying transaction history is slow (2-5 seconds)
- High load on RPC endpoints
- Direct blockchain calls for every request

### Suggested Solutions

**Indexer Options:**

- **The Graph Protocol** (decentralized, GraphQL)
- **Moralis** (easy integration, multi-chain)
- **Custom Indexer** (Ponder - full control)

**Expected Improvement:** 80-90% faster (200-500ms)

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Hybrid approach with fallback to blockchain calls
2. **Phase 2**: Full migration to indexer with caching
3. **Phase 3**: Real-time updates via WebSocket

## üí± 2. Swap Feature Scalability

### Current Issues

- Synchronous processing (blocking user)
- Single point of failure in price API
- Low throughput (~10 swaps/minute)
- No retry mechanism

### Suggested Solutions

#### A. Async Processing with Job Queues

- **Tool**: Bull/BullMQ with Redis
- **Flow**: Immediate response ‚Üí background processing ‚Üí status updates
- **Benefit**: Users receive a response in <500ms

#### B. Multiple Price Sources

- **Sources**: Alchemy + CoinGecko + Coinbase
- **Strategy**: Parallel fetching with weighted average
- **Fallback**: Cascade to backup sources

#### C. Batch Processing

- **Group**: Swaps based on amount ranges
- **Timing**: Process in batches every 5 seconds or 25 swaps
- **Benefit**: Reduce gas costs, higher throughput

#### D. Circuit Breaker Pattern

- **Purpose**: Prevent cascade failures
- **Fallback**: Queue swaps when service is down
- **Recovery**: Auto-retry with exponential backoff

**Expected Improvement:** 50x throughput (500+ swaps/minute)

## üìä 3. Monitoring Requirements

### Key Metrics

- Query response times
- Swap success rates
- Queue depths
- Price source availability
- Error rates by type

### Tools

- Prometheus + Grafana
- Custom health checks
- AlertManager for notifications

## üéØ 4. Implementation Priority

### Immediate (1-2 months)

1. Job queue system for swaps
2. Multiple price sources integration
3. Basic monitoring setup

### Medium (3-4 months)

1. Blockchain indexer integration
2. Batch processing implementation
3. Advanced caching strategies

### Long-term (6+ months)

1. Microservice architecture
2. Horizontal scaling
3. Advanced fraud detection

**üí° Important Notes:**

- Always implement fallback mechanisms
- Test thoroughly before production
- Monitor performance improvements
- Document changes for maintenance
